This theme is heavily based on Omega5
Most of the code to make it work with different layouts and generating the cs
for different screens based on the layout is from Omega5

There are calls in <theme>.theme to php files which do some of this.
Some of it is clever use of scss mixins etc.. Some has been 'tweaked' by
norwegian.blue

There are a few custom mixins in _<theme>_mixins.scss which are of general use.

To configure layouts, firstly ensure twig templates are correct 
Then alter as required the layout scss files. NOTE the parrot_default shouldn't
be altered. 

Omega5 uses the yml files in config/install to generate the layout css files.
This theme doesn't have the necessary triggers to make this happen, so editing
the scss files directly is required.

_<theme>gs.scss has the 'smarts' in to calculate the css required to make the 
layouts appear right at different device widths (as defined in the -layout.scss
files)

This theme has the twig template, the css and the .theme php required for
parallax scrolling images. The front page displays these as a slideshow and the
other pages has the ability to show multiples as fixed bg image 'stripes'
