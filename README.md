This is a personal repo for quickly creating new Drupal 8 websites on my local machine for development.<br>
The scripts use standard D8 composer installation process,
copies a set of files such as settings.php customised to my use,
and installs some modules I usually use using composer.<br>
It also adds the entry to the aliases.drushrc.php file assuming the user running
the script has access rights to the file.<br>
git is also initialised in the new site's directory and a gitignore created.<br>
The scripts are bash and use kdialog, so assume kde is installed.
